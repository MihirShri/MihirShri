### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Mihir. I'm a Computer Science undergrad pursuing my B.Tech from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, situated in Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu. I am currently in the final (4th) year of my studies.

I have been developing websites for over 2 years now. I'm a self taught Full-Stack Developer. The tech stack I'm currently using is **React** and **NEXTjs** for front end and **Ruby on Rails** for backend. But I don't limit myself to these fameworks. Depending upon the usage, I even prefer to use the **MERN** (Mongodb, Express, React, Nodejs) stack. I feel that frameworks are just tools to help us in the development process, but no matter what you use, ultimately it all boils down to whether you can apply the logic required to build something!
